### Colors

The colors of the larva paths used in the debug image come from
[wikipedia's distinguishable colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Distinguishable_colors)
from the *Colour Alphabet Project* which resemble
[Kelly's 22 color set [pdf]](https://eleanormaclure.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/colour-coding.pdf).
