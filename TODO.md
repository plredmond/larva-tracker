# Issues, limitations, and wishlist

todo: (sooo meta!)

* many settings values are not derived from the video itself (although,
  many are too)
* summary of remaining todos/fixmes
* wishlist
    * option to disable video output
    * cleanup of top-level processes
    * put this on heroku and give it a gui?
